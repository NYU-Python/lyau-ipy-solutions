###For this problem, I need to build a dictionary of dictionaries where:
###{a: {b:c, b2:c2}, a2:{b3:c3, b4:c4}}  'a' is the outer key (the 'by' field in the args),
###'b' is the inner key which is the 'info' arg and 'c' is the number of occurences of 'b'.
###The final result would limit the 'b's shown depending on the 'number' arg the user requested (ie. the top 5)

###create a dictionary to refer to for which elements of the lines to read depending on what the user 
###wants to see. Every key is associated with an index of where that data is found in the bit.ly file

outerkeydict={'timestamp':0,'platform':1,'referring_url':2,'short_url_cname':3,'long_url':4,
    'geo_city_name':5, 'country_code':6, 'geo_region':7,'accept_language':8, 'timezone':9}

    if not number.isdigit():
        sys.exit("First argument should be a number.")
    if info not in outerkeydict:
        sys.exit("Second argument should be from this list: {0}".format(outerkeydict.keys()))
    if by not in outerkeydict:
        sys.exit("Third argument should be from the following list: {0}".format(outerkeydict.keys()))
